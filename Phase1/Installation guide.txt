Welcome to my submission of Project Phase 1.

####################################################################################################
Requirements:
To run the code, you need python 2.7.
Install the most suitable python 2.7 version from
                    https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

Linux generally comes with python 2.7 installed.

To check if you have the required python version, type "python --version" in your command line and check.

If you have installed python and it still doesn't work, add python path where python.exe file is located on windows
environment variables and windows path. Instructions to follow can be found in the link

                    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7

Once python is installed, make sure you have pip installed. Python comes with pip.

Dependencies needed for this to work are numpy and pandas

They can be installed using the following commands once python 2.7 is running on cmd or terminal

                    python -m pip install numpy
                    python -m pip install pandas

Once installed, you can go into the codes directory and run the commands for the tasks given below


####################################################################################################
Execution:
Task 1
To run task 1, go to the Code directory, open a command line interface and enter command

                    python print_actor_vector.py actorid model

where actorid can be replaced by any integer from the list of actorids in the dataset
and model can only take two values “tf” and “tfidf”


Task 2
To run task 2, go to the Code directory, open a command line interface and enter command

                    python print_genre_vector.py genre model

where genre can be replaced by any of the 19 genres from the list of genres in the dataset
and model can only take two values “tf” and “tfidf”

Task 3
To run task 3, go to the Code directory, open a command line interface and enter command

                    python print_user_vector.py userid model

where userid can be replaced by any of the userids given the tags and ratings data in the
dataset and model can only take two values “tf” and “tfidf”

Task 4
To run task 4, go to the Code directory, open a command line interface and enter command

                    python differentiate_genre.py genre1 genre2 model

where genre1 and genre2 can be replaced by any of the genres given the movies data in the
dataset and model can only take values “tfidf”, “pdiff1” and “pdiff2”


Task X
To run all the tasks for all the possible options, I have created an option. This option will allow
you to generate data for all the tasks and all possible input options and then store them in the
output file. You can change the dataset and generate the output for all possible combinations
and analyze them if you wish to. The command to enter on command line in Code directory is:

                    python generate_all_output.py
