Welcome to my submission of Project Phase 1.

####################################################################################################
Requirements:
To run the code, you need python 2.7.
Install the most suitable python 2.7 version from
                    https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

Linux generally comes with python 2.7 installed.

To check if you have the required python version, type "python --version" in your command line and check.

If you have installed python and it still doesn't work, add python path where python.exe file is located on windows
environment variables and windows path. Instructions to follow can be found in the link

                    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-7

Once python is installed, make sure you have pip installed. Python comes with pip.

Dependencies needed for this to work are numpy and pandas

They can be installed using the following commands once python 2.7 is running on cmd or terminal

                    python -m pip install numpy
                    python -m pip install pandas

Once installed, you can go into the codes directory and run the commands for the tasks given below
